      "🤗 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 hosts hundreds of AI models. Without real inheritance the library would become unmaintainable. \n",
      "\n",
      "In Spring 2024 we shipped 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀: A model can now be declared as a composition of other models, the runnable 𝚖𝚘𝚍𝚎𝚕𝚒𝚗𝚐_*.𝚙𝚢 is generated from that modular file. \n",
      "\n",
      "I measured the effect straight from git history: at every commit I counted LOC (lines of code) under src/transformers/models, but if a model has a modular_*.py I count it. That gives an “effective LOC” curve: the 𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲.\n",
      "\n",
      "𝗝𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸 𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁: 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗽𝘀𝗲𝗱! Counting raw 𝚖𝚘𝚍𝚎𝚕𝚒𝚗𝚐_*.𝚙𝚢 (with “Copied from…” everywhere) we were around 362 LOC/day; with 𝚖𝚘𝚍𝚞𝚕𝚊𝚛 in place the effective rate is ~25 LOC/day. About 𝟭𝟱× 𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿! Had we continued with a strict \"one model, one file\" policy who knows where we'd have ended up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Less code to hand-maintain means fewer places to break. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cyclomatic complexity isn’t LOC, but they strongly correlate. As Les Hatton notes, defects scale like 𝙙 ~ 𝙭 𝙡𝙣 𝙭. Lower 𝘅 (lower loc) helps.\n",
      "Fewer lines, less scrolling, fewer bugs. Easier to contribute, easier to fix! \n",
      "\n",
      "I ramble a lot about good system design and good design patterns, but it's not (just) to show off cool graphs. It's because 𝘨𝘰𝘰𝘥 𝘴𝘰𝘧𝘵𝘸𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘪𝘴 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘺 𝘣𝘶𝘪𝘭𝘵 𝘰𝘯 𝘨𝘰𝘰𝘥 𝘥𝘦𝘤𝘪𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴, and I wanted to highlight one.\n",

      "⚠️ Serious release of new learning material! This is days and weeks of hard study. Focusing on post training AI models. This is four chapters of the smol course. Which cover all the major aspects plus more to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chapters cover: \n",
      "\n",
      "- Evaluating Large Language models on benchmarks and custom use cases\n",
      "- Preference Alignment with DPO\n",
      "- Fine tuning Vision Language Models for tasks like DocQA and Browser control.\n",
      "- Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning  \n",
      "- Supervised Fine-Tuning LLMs release two weeks ago\n",
      "\n",
      "All this material is completely free. It all runs on colab or the hub. And you can get certificates for each chapter of the course!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting today, you can use VLMs directly on Hugging Face AISheets. \n",
      "\n",
      "Try it:\n",
      "https://lnkd.in/gdKeV-zW\n",
      "Here's an example:\n",
      "One of the most exciting use cases of VLMs is assisting people who are blind or have low vision. I asked myself the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Can I use VLMs to describe artworks helpfully? If so, how can I test whether the descriptions are accurate or useful without reading them all?\n",
      "\n",
      "So I built the following workflow without writing a line of code:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Import the wikiart dataset from HF\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Write a prompt to describe the image using Qwen-2.5-VL\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Use the description to generate images using Qwen-Image\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
